https://cerulea.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/

This project represents something of a cross between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch.
    *Hover your mouse over the squares to color them.
    *Toggle between normal and random colors.
    *Enter light sketch mode to color squares lightly, requiring 10 mouse hovers to fully color a square.

Completion of this project demonstrates proficiency in HTML and CSS, as well as DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
